                <h2 class="titu">Prologue</h2>

                <p class="parrafo">Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with
                friends around the world while playing games online. Since
                childhood, founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a
                love of video games, cherishing the friendships and connections that
                formed while playing them. At the time, all the tools built for this
                job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan knew they
                could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form
                memories, and recreated the felling of togetherness all found
                through gaming.</p>

                <h2 class="titu">Chapter One</h2>

                <p class="parrafo">So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People
                from all over the world loved it. Discord made it easy to genuinely
                communicate with friends, going beyond casual talking. Friends were
                staying in touch with their various communities. Discord was making
                it easy to participate in conversation, hopping around text, voice
                and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal was
                simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into
                with your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began
                to take off, and devoted people who loved our product sprung up
                around the world.</p>
